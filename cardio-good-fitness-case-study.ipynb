Final Observations and Inferences","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"- Total sales for Cardio Good Fitness treadmills of unit price USD 1500(TM195) is USD 120000, USD 1750(TM498) is USD 105000, USD 2500(TM798) is USD 100000\n\n- TM798 Treadmill with advanced features is preffered by the customers with higher income.\n\n- TM195 Treadmill with the lowest cost and basic features is preffered by the customers with lower income and the TM498 product with moderate features are liked by the customers with upper bracket of low - moderate income group.\n\n- TM195 model is the most purchased model (44.4%) then TM498 (33.3%). \n- TM798 is the least sold model (22.2%).\n- There are more Male customers (57.8%) than Female customers (42.2%).\n- Average Usage of Males is more than Average usage of Females.\n- Customers buying treadmill are younger and average age of customer is 28.\n- Most of the customers earns less than 70K and prefer TM195 & TM498 models.\n- 59.4% of the customers who purchased treadmill are partnered.\n- Customers average education is 16.\n- Most customers have income less than 70k.\n- Customers run on an average 80 miles per week.\n\n- There aren't any significant outliers for Bivariate Analysis of Products and the Income of customers purchasing those products. So no need for outlier removal here.\n\n- After outlier removal for income, 19 rows are deleted and in order to draw some insights from the original data in future, stored the modied data in it's shallow copy - **df_scopy**\n\n- In the boxplot, we can clearly see that most of the outliers are removed and the data is now ready for further analysis and inferences.\n\n- After dealing with outliers, we can infer that, there's a 7.31% correction in the Income data after removing outliers as we can see that the difference in the mean and median has decreased from 3123 to 228. Hence the new dataframe i.e **df_scopy**is more suitable for carrying further analysis w.r.t income and gender related cases.\n\n- Most of the buyers who have income greater than 80K, prefers to buy product TM798 with advanced features.\n\n- **Significant no. of Outliers (higher end) are present** as there are very few persons who earn >80k. This makes us mandatory to handle outliers which has been taken care in the first case. Shallow copy of our dataframe(**ds_scopy**) consists of modified data after dealing with ouliers.\n\n- Also, After further analysis, we got to know that, as the **with dataframe without income ouliers, we aren't getting any significant disturbances expect the higher income group, hence it's benefetial to keep outliers i.e first (df) for further inferences as if we use df_scopy, then it might lead us to falsification of data due to data deletion**\n\n- Customers having lower income range (<60K) prefer to buy models TM195 & TM498 and expect to use treadmill 2-5 times/week.\n\n- Mostly Higher earning customers bought TM798 and expect to use treadmill 4-6 times/week.\n\n\n**Inferences with Customer Profiles** : \n\n\n- The target audience for TM798 Treadmill should be the higher income group. So the sales team must focus on this range.\n\n- **The sales team should focus the high range product's marketing to males who are married and have higher income than 50k and who uses the product more than or equal to 4 times in a week and who have education more than or equal to 16 years**(This should be the target audience for TM798)\n\n- High cost/advanced featured TM798 product usage is more among people who are buying it. So, it's a win - win situation for the company to focus on the target audience - (to **MALES** who are **MARRIED** and have **higher income than 50k** and who uses the product more than or equal to **4 times in a week(usage)** and who have **education more than or equal to 16 years**)\n\n- Education level is directly correlated with income as highlighted in the pairplot and correlation heatmap above, so highly educated indviduals are more likely to purchase the more expensive model.The sales team should focus on this aspect.\n\nBusiness Recommendation for TM498:\n\n- **Among the low to moderate income groups, TM498 is more preferred over TM195 in terms of usage per week i.e 2-4 times/week. If the salesman, gets such insights from the customers willing to purchase treadmills,  he/she should definitely pitch in the moderate range (TM498) product. If the insights are w.r.t fitness and the person is moderately fir (2-4), then also, the salesman should pitch in for TM498 as it's most appealing as it has more features than basic one and less expensive than the advance one. The overall sales should focus on how to increase the market cap of this moderate ranged product so that the company will earn more rather than focusing on the basic one. This is evident from the calculations of total units sold and revenue earned by company for TM498 is USD 105000, which is nearly equal to (TM798) whose revenue  is USD 100000, given the units sold for TM498 are 20 more than TM798.\nSo to conclude, the target for the company should be to increase the overall percentage for TM498 and make it highest selling product and with the given  statistics, it's bound to boost the income for Cardio Good Fitness in long run.**\n\n\n\n**1.
